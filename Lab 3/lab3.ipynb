    "1. ##### Difference between Ham and Spam\n",
    "    Spam contains a lot of clickbaity titles with links that looks more than suspicious. Very sensational language and the senders adress looks very auto-generated for example: sabrina@mx3.1premio.com.\n",
    "    Ham on the other hand is more legit and the emails looks like they are sent from either real people or real companys with a newsletter and you get the choice to unsubscribe or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ##### Difference between Hard and Easy Ham\n",
    "    Easy ham seems to be mostly conversations between real life people, not alot of code, mostly natural speaking language\n",
    "    Hard Ham contains more code, and contains mostly of commercials which makes it hard to judge if it's actually wanted by the reciever or not."
